1.MyApplication (QR_Code_Generator):

I developed this QR_Code_Generator project Using Zxing ("Zebra Crossing") Library, Android Studio and JAVA. ZXing ("zebra crossing") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java, with ports to other languages. Zebra Crossing Library is the Library provided by Google.

Android Studio provides a unified environment where you can build apps for Android phones, tablets, etc. The official language for Android development is Java. Large parts of Android are written in Java and its APIs are designed to be called primarily from Java.

QR_code_generator encodes information into a QR code. A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background. Each QR code consists of different pieces of information. There are several variants of QR codes depending on their symbol size, layout, encoding and structure.

2. Mul App:

This is a simple multiplication app in which we give a number as input and the table of that number is printed on the screen.

3. Unit Converter:

I have developed these apps using java and android studio.
